<p>The StreetCred<sup>&reg;</sup> Police Killings in Context (PKIC) database is an open-standard data set that includes incidents (other than traffic accidents) in which an unarmed civilian was killed during an encounter with American police who (whether on-, or off-duty) were acting in an official capacity, from the time of first contact through booking. Excluded from this database are civilians killed in the following circumstances:</p
<ul>
<li>Vehicle fatalities.
<li>Deaths that occur in a county or municipal jail after booking. 
<li>Deaths that occur in prison.
<li>Acts committed by police officers while the officer was off-duty and not acting in an offical capacity. An example of this type of event is a domestic dispute involving a police officer.
</ul>

<h3>Role of police in the US criminal justice system</h3>
<p>The police are one arm of the three-armed Criminal Justice system. The other two are Courts, and Corrections. Because the United States has more than 17,000 local law enforcement agencies, each of which is managed locally, with general but not specific control from county, state and federal governments, there are no universal rules or procedures on how individual agencies are run. America’s police are highly de-centralized. In the United States, the corrections arm of the criminal justice system maintains prisons, and some jails.</p>

<p>Police departments may exist at several levels of government, including municipalities, counties, state, and federal. Some police departments that are not at the federal level may also jurisdiction across multiple state, county, or municipals. Examples of this kind of departent is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has jursidiction over a set of transportation-related activities in two differnt states. Note that in the state of Louisiana, parishes are equivalent to counties in other parts of the US.

<h3>Glossary of key terms used by StreetCred</h3>

<p><u>911</u>: A three-digit abbreviated dialing telephone number used in the United States to contact local emergency services, including police, fire, and medical emergency services.</p>

<p><u>Armed</u>: A situation where a person is holding an object that may appear to a reasonable person to be a gun, knife, or any object that may be used as a deadly weapon, or if they are behaving in a manner that a reasonable person would confuse for that of a person drawing, displaying or otherwise brandishing a deadly weapon. A person does not have to posess an acutal deadly weapon, or a weapon that is capable of inflicting deadly force, in order to be considred armed. </p>

<p><u>Booking</u>: The process used to create an offical arrest record. The process typically includes taking a photograph of the arrested person, as well as that person's fingerprints, taking away the arrested person's personal property, and conducting a full body search. This process may take place in a jail or in a police booking procedure.</p>

<p><u>Custody</u>: A state where a person, through words or deeds of a police officer, is either under arrest or is not free to leave the officer's control.Constructive custody, is when a person may not be under direct physical control but whose freedom is controlled by legal authority, such as a person told by an officer to, "Stay here," or someone under parole or probation. Typically, when an officer informs a person that they are under arrest, that person is in the custody of that officer. A death of that person from that time until the officer books the person into the jail would be considered a, "death in custody."   </p>

<p><u>Fugitive</u>: A person who has active warrants for their arrest. It is not an indication that the person has escaped custody. One can be a fugitive without being an escapee. An arrest warrant may be issued for misdemeanor or felony charges; if any arrest warrant was active for the decedent at the time of his death, this is answered Y.</p>

<p><u>Jail</u>: A confinement facility designed to hold people awaiting trial, or serving short sentences; typically of less than one year. Jails are typically managed either by the office of the county Sheriff, or by a municipality, or a county government. Jail officers are not typically police officers, even if they are working as a corrections officer or jailer run by a county Sheriff, though they ultimately are responsible to, and the Sheriff is ultimately responsible for, the jail.</p> 

<br><u>Police officer</u>: A member of a police force who is authorized to enforce laws, investigate crimes or suspected crimes, make arrests, search or seize property, and detain individuals for short periods of time. Duties include preventing or detecting crime, monitoring suspected criminal activity, protecting and assiting the general public, and maintaining public order. In the US, police officers may or may not wear a uniform, and are typically armed while on duty with one or more lethal or non-leathal weapons.
</p>

<br><u>Narcotics</u>: Psychoactive compounds with sleep-inducing properties. These may include marijuana and hashish, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, flakka, bath salts, K2, opium, and other recreational non-prescription drugs. Not all drugs are narcotics. For example, stimulants such as methamphetamine are not classified as a narcotic.
</p>
<br><u>TASER</u>: A less-than-lethal weapon which uses electrical current to disrupt voluntary muscle control and immobilize a person. The term TASER; a trademarked term owned by the manufactuer, TASER International; is an ancronym for "Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle." The acronym was inspired by the title of a Victor Appleton novel "Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle."
</p>


<p><u>Prison</u>: A confinement facility, typically run by the state or federal government, that generally houses prisoners convicted of crimes punishable by one year or more. Corrections officers in prisons are typically not police officers.

<p><u>Warrant</u>: A specific type of authorization issued by a competent court officer, such as a judge or magistrate, which legally permits an otherwise illegal act that would violate an individual's rights, and that allows the person executing the authorization protection from legal damages if the act is performed.</p>

<br>911_call_reported_armed (Category)

<br>Alarm_Triggered (Category)
<br>An alarm, either through a security company dispatcher or an automated alarm, or a 911 or other call prompted by an alarm. One example of this is the incident involving Christian Taylor, who found destroying vehicles and property at an Arlington, TX car dealership after police were summoned by the alarm system.

<br>Other_Community_Contact (Category)
<br>A community contact other than a 911- or emergency call. This includes waving down a traveling police officer, or approaching an officer engaged in an unrelated activity and reporting directly to that officer information about a crime or incident in progress. It also includes officers spotting someone who is the target of an arrest warrant signed by a judge, or a known fugitive.

<br>911_CFS (Category)

<br>Prison_death_in_custody (Category)
<br>PKIC does not include deaths in prisons; this column is here for an eventual expansion. In the United States, the police are one arm of the three-armed Criminal Justice system. The other two are Courts, and Corrections. Because the United States has more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies, each of which is managed locally, with general but not specific control from county, state and federal governments, there are no universal rules or procedures on how individual agencies are run. America’s police are highly de-centralized. In the United States, the corrections arm of the criminal justice system maintains prisons, and some jails.

<br>Jail_death_in_custody (Category)
<br>In PKIC, these refer to municipal holding jails only, prior to booking. After someone is arrested, they are typically brought to a municipal jail, or a police booking facility. These are typically very short-term confinement facilities (typically measured in periods of under 30 days) designed to process prisoners arrested by the police before they are transferred to a jail to await trial, or to serve time on minor misdemeanor offenses. Often, but not always, this facility is operated by the police department. Once the person has been booked-in to the jail and processed, they will be transferred to jail. Police officers in smaller agencies may serve as booking officials and/or jailer, though these tasks are also often carried out by civilian employees.

<br>Died_In_Officer_Custody (Category)
<br>In the United States, when dealing with a police officer, a person is generally considered to be “in custody” when the officer has told them through words or deeds that they are not free to leave, or that they are under arrest. Constructive custody, is when a person may not be under direct physical control but whose freedom is controlled by legal authority, such as a person told by an officer to, “Stay here,” or someone under parole or probation. Typically, when an officer informs a person that they are under arrest, that person is in the custody of that officer. A death of that person from that time until the officer books the person into the jail would be considered a, “death in custody.” PKIC uses this column to differentiate a death at this stage of the process from one that happens when the person is in a jail or prison facility.

<br>FEDB_COD (Text)
<br>The cause of death as listed by the Fatal Encounters database.

<br>Official_COD1 (Text)

This may be quoted from, in order of StreetCred PKIC preference: extracted verbatim from a copy of the official autopsy report; extracted verbatim from police, or district- or county-attorney press statements; or extracted verbatim as a quote from a reputable newspaper (see, Methodology). Absent any of those, the listing is U.

<br>Official_COD2 (Text)
<br>The second cause of death listed in an official autopsy, as in Official_COD1 above.

This may be quoted from, in order of StreetCred PKIC preference: extracted verbatim from a copy of the official autopsy report; extracted verbatim from police, or district- or county-attorney press statements; or extracted verbatim as a quote from a reputable newspaper (see, Methodology). Absent any of those, the listing is U. As examples, if a news story lists the race of the officer with a construction such as, “Officer X, who is white”, or, “Officer X is black” then the race may be stated. If no such specific mention is made, even if a photograph of the officer exists in the story, the race of the officer is U. StreetCred PKIC does not analyze race or genealogy through photographs.

<br>Race_of_Officer_2 (Category)

Absent any of those, the listing is U. As an example, if a media report discusses the name of the officer involved in a force incident and lists a clearly male name, refers to the officer as “he” or “she”, or actions or equipment belonging to that officer as “his” or “hers” then the gender of the officer may be stated as MALE or FEMALE.
